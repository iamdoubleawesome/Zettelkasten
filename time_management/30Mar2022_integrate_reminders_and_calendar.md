# Integrate  `reminders` and `calendar`

- My first attempt was to integrate `reminders` and `calendar` in Mac. I knew we could use `shortcuts` in iPad and iPhone to achieve this. However, there seems no valid solution in Mac. So I went up google(my best friend), still, no solution; but I got stroked by an answer in zhihu, to ask myself **WHY** do I need to integrate them.
- Reasons:
  - For now, I mainly use `reminders` and I would to add some event in `reminders` and also show in `calendar`, such as today's 美丽中国 class. 
  - I also want to build up habits for some of my routines, especially `Anki`, I want to do it the first round as the first thing in the morning and also my `solve a problem a day` project.
  - Maybe it can help me to track down how I use my time every day?
- However, after reading the answer, I need to oppose my idea for the following reasons:
  - There are few **must do** events per day actually. 
    - To keep them **untouchable**, ie, if they are written down, only change them if crush with higher priority tasks.
    - We should not put **not-must-do** or **no-time-related** tasks into calendar from this perspective, ie, `Anki` or `solve a problem a day` since they can't be defined when exactly I must do it.
    - This means I better keep calendar clean and minimalism, so *I cleaned up my calendar*.
  - Tracking down time is very time, attention and energy consuming. 
    - I tried few times and every time I failed. Failed very hardly. So I think this is not a method for me. 
    - Tracking time is for improvement of my time management, but if it makes me feel very stressful and regretful, I better think other method to improve my efficiency.
    - Another thing of time block panning is that most of the time, I don't know how much time I used for one thing.
    - A lot of my tasks for now is studying, so its object-oriented, which cannot be estimated properly. 
    - I think for now, the most important one is to have a `not-changing` biological clock, ie, get up and go to sleep around same time every day. **What about 7am ⇨ 11pm?**

My other questions about this and my first solutions:

- Regarding reminders, is it okay to have so long list, so many tasks?
  - The most difficult one is not to have too long overall list, is to have priority and follow it, and also limit everyday's task number.
  - And also dump the ones with low priority, or postponed for a long time.
  - Maybe the first thing in the morning, is to open my reminders app and also calendar, rank my tasks.
  - **Important urgent (do) > important not urgent (schedule) > not important but urgent (delegate) > not important not urgent (delete)**
- I haven't continued my study of the book and also data, algorithms for a long time, how can I get out of this situation?
  - They are my **important not urgent tasks**, I need to schedule them ⇨ put on my calendar!



The answer in the post said:

> 使用提醒事项来完成自己的ToDoList，包括日常的目标的达成路径中的小里程碑、习惯养成的提醒器、到期时间未定或比较远，在那之前的任何时间做完都可以的具有优先级排序的琐事等。而当一件事情细化为日程表上的一个**不可撼动**的项时，比如把前述所说的琐事具体的安排到将来的某一个时间点日程时，我会手动把它加到日程表上（如果现在立刻就顺手做了，那就直接打个勾标记完成了）

- From my point of view, this **manually** adding is necessary, is to ask myself to think, okay, you are putting this event into `calendar`, which means you will have to do it unless other very important tasks coming.
- My "untouchable" shrine: **calendar**.
