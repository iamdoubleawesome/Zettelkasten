# `tr`

`tr` states for translate.

```bash
a="1 2 3 4"
echo $a | tr " " ","
# 1,2,3,4
```



Or we can use special identifier for `tr`

```bash
a="1 2 3 4"
echo $a | tr "[:space:]" ","
# 1,2,3,4,
```



Also we will have

```bash
a="hello"
echo $a | tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]"
# HELLO
```

or 

```bash
a="hello"
echo $a | tr "a-z" "A-Z"
# HELLO
echo $a | tr "h-n" "H-N"
# HeLLo
```
