# Method Resolution Order

### Diamond problem: multi inheritance

```python
class A:
    def rk(self):
        print("In class A")
class B(A):
    def rk(self):
        print("In class B")
class C(A):
    def rk(self):
        print("In class C")
  
# classes ordering
class D(B, C):
    pass
     
r = D()
r.rk()
# In class B
```

### Linearisation

The order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method.



### MRO

Method Resolution Order (MRO) is an <u>algorithm</u> for the construction of linearisation - the list of all the ancestors of a class, including the class itself, ordered from the closest to the furthest. This is the order in which methods and attributes are looked up.

- In the above `diamond problem`, the lookup order of `D` is `D -> B -> C -> A`

In `python`, [C3 linearisation](24Mar2022_C3_linearisation.md) is being used.
