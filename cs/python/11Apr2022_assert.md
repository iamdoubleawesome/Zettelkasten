# assert

`assert condition [, error message]` is used to check if condition is `True` otherwise it raises `AssertionError` with specified error message.

```python
a = 5
assert a > 10, "need to be greater than 10"
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#     assert a > 10, "need to be greater than 10"
# AssertionError: need to be greater than 10
```
